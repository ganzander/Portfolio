    "ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Ganesh Kumar Mangla, an enthusiastic undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering with a focus on Full Stack Web Development (MERN) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). With a keen interest in both front-end and back-end technologies, I've honed my skills in Next.js, React.js, Reduxjs, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. On the backend, I'm proficient in server-side languages like Node.js and databases like MongoDB and MySQL. Additionally, my solid understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms equips me to tackle complex problems efficiently. Proficient in C++, I have experience in developing efficient and scalable applications, leveraging object-oriented programming principles to design robust software solutions. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence to incorporate into my web development projects, and I'm always excited to participate in hackathons to push my creative boundaries.",
